# gestalt
Project experimenting with absolute and fixed positioning for headers and footers, as well as inline-block display for page content. I also used the invert property to invert black and white colours when user hovers over images. The content is based on Gestalt psychology and the concept of seeing the whole as being different from the sum of it's parts, a concept that is also explored in User Interface design, and quantum cognition modelling.
